<h2>Go-Server</h2>

This time I want to share my learning results sourced from freeCodeCamp.

To run it, you can build <pre>go build</pre> or running <pre>go run main.go</pre> if you just want to run the application.

When you are doing a build and an error occurs

<code>go: go.mod file not found in current directory or any parent directory; see 'go help modules'</code>

You can run this command <pre>go env -w GO111MODULE=off</pre>

Thank you and Happy Coding!
